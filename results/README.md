Adding TEST Changes

The raw data processing successfully transformed Baseball-Reference CSV files from their messy original format into clean, simulation-ready datasets by loading 7 rows of batting data and 6 rows of pitching data, removing 2-3 contaminated header rows that Baseball-Reference embeds within the data, converting all statistical columns from text objects to numeric data types with zero conversion errors, renaming inconsistent column names (BA to AVG for consistency), filling any missing values using position-based median imputation for batters and role-based imputation for pitchers (starters vs relievers), and producing final clean datasets of 5 players from 4 teams with OPS ranging 0.765-1.111 (best: Aaron Judge at 1.111) and 5 pitchers from 5 teams with ERA ranging 1.31-3.80 (best: Edwin Díaz at 1.31), achieving 100% data quality scores with all validation checks passed and datasets ready for Monte Carlo simulation with realistic statistical ranges, proper data types, and no missing critical values.
